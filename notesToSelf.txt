Renderer Process

- Handles user interactions, UI rendering, and frontend logic.
- Communicates with the main process via IPC channels exposed by Electronâ€™s preload.js.

Component Flow 

- Components can fetch data from the main process via IPC or interact with browser APIs provided by the preload script.


Single Page Application (Single Renderer)

- Pages are seaprate React Components 
- Runs on a single renderer 
- The BrowserWindow remains the same, and the React app dynamically updates the DOM.

- Pages are React components within a single React app (SPA model). Fast, simple, suitable for most apps.


(AND/OR) Multi-renderer setup

- Separate Renderer with its own BrowserWindow or WebView.
- Communication between windows or with the main process is done via IPC.


Routing

- Use Hashrouter (#) Instead of default router (/)
- Browser works in dev where electron uses html:// but
- Eletron uses file system in prod
- Hash is used for file-based environments


Electron Load Order

- Electron shows index.html whilst React is being mounted onto the root
